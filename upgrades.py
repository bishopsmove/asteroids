This class holds information on upgrades the ship can have.

Upgrade ideas:

* fire more bullets at once
* fire bullets at a faster rate
* fire bullets further
* more shields
* space-brake (lose speed gradually)
* space-treads (ship can magically adjust direction of movement when turning)
* shield regeneration (shields slowly regenerate)
* another life
* shield re-fill
* faster engines (higher acceleration)
* triple-shot (shoot 3 bullets in a W pattern)
* money-bot (little bot that goes and gathers the money)
* smart-bullets (bullets don't kill shield or money pickups)
* High-powered laser (gets 3 shots, fires a hitscan shot that extends to the edge of the screen)
* cluster-bullets (when a bullet reaches the end of its life, it explodes into several small short-lived bullets that do half damage)
* anti-asteroid magnet: asteroids are slightly repeled from your ship
* Insurance: all upgrades are kept upon death
